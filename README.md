**Background**

Older adults and Indigenous peoples are placed more vulnerable to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Objective**
1. To determine the association between sociodemographic variables with self-reported COVID-19 symptoms.
2. To investigate whether this relationship shows inequalities by ethnicity and age.

**Methods**

Using the *[2020 Household Survey](http://anda.ine.gob.bo/index.php/catalog/88/get-microdata)* I performed bivariate analysis to establish trends.
Subsequently using logistic regressions to establish the risks to self-reported COVID-19 symptoms.
A fully interacted model is analysed by ethnicity.

**Results**

> Those who were living alone were less likely than those living in a Couple with/without relatives’ household arrangement to self-reported COVID-19 symptoms (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.66–0.94, p < .01).
>
> Odds of the older persons aged 45-59 (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.27–1.62, p < .05) were relatively more likely than younger people (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.05–1.35, p < .01). Indigenous living in a couple with/without children household arrangement were less likely than non-Indigenous (OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.62–0.90, p < .01).
>
> Odds of Indigenous people of age 30-44 (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.04–1.53, p < .01) were more likely than non-Indigenous.
>
> Odds of Indigenous persons of age 45-59 (OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.32–1.91, p < .05) were more likely than non-Indigenous (OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.12–1.55, p < .01).

**Conclusions**

> 45-59 age group shows higher risk factors and those aged 60+ show lower risks. These are increased in people working in managerial, administrative and professional, and technical positions, those living in a household with/without relatives, men, those living in urban areas, and/or non-indigenous people.
